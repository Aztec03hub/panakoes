# Dev environment ECR providers.
#
# This config creates the Elastic Container Registry repositories that
# back every Panakoes microservice container image for the `dev`
# environment. Each repo is encrypted with a single shared dev-tier
# customer-managed KMS key created in this module, has image tag
# immutability, scan-on-push, and a shared lifecycle policy that
# expires old / untagged images.
#
# Backend values are hardcoded because Terraform does not allow
# variables in the backend block. They mirror the outputs of
# `infra/bootstrap/`. The `key` namespaces this configuration's state
# inside the bucket so other configs do not collide.
