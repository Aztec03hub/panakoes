# Dev environment AWS Backup providers.
#
# This config provisions the AWS Backup vault and plan that protect
# the dev environment's stateful resources. State is namespaced under
# `dev/backup/` in the shared S3 backend created by `infra/bootstrap/`.
#
# Backend values are hardcoded because Terraform does not allow
# variables in the backend block. They mirror the outputs of
# `infra/bootstrap/`.
