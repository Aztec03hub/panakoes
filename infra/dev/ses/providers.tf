# Dev environment SES providers.
#
# This config provisions Amazon SES identities, a configuration set
# with CloudWatch event publishing, and the dedicated IAM user used
# to derive SMTP credentials for transactional email (notification
# service plus any future SMTP sender). State is namespaced under
# `dev/ses/` in the shared S3 backend created by `infra/bootstrap/`.
#
# Backend values are hardcoded because Terraform does not allow
# variables in the backend block. They mirror the outputs of
# `infra/bootstrap/`.
