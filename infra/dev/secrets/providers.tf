# Dev environment Secrets Manager providers.
#
# This config provisions the AWS Secrets Manager secrets used by the
# dev environment microservices: JWT signing key, third-party API
# keys, Stripe credentials, Postgres password and connection URL, and
# SES SMTP credentials. Each secret is created with a placeholder
# value; real values are written post-apply via the AWS CLI (see this
# module's README). State is namespaced under `dev/secrets/` in the
# shared S3 backend created by `infra/bootstrap/`.
#
# Backend values are hardcoded because Terraform does not allow
# variables in the backend block. They mirror the outputs of
# `infra/bootstrap/`.
